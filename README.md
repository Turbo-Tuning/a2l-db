# a2l-db
ASAM MCD-2 MC (aka A2L) to DB (SQLite) converter

USAGE: 
  "./a2l-db a2l-file"
 
 Converts an A2L file into a more usable SQLite database
  
  The converter is designed to be as fast as possible, with most files processed within a second. Compared to other scripts, this beats them all hands-down.
  
  Tested with over 4000 A2L files
  
  Pull requests are welcome
