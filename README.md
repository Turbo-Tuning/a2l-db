# a2l-db
ASAM MCD-2 MC (aka A2L) parser

USAGE: 
  "./a2l-db a2l-file"
 
 Converts an A2L file into a collection of objects, which are serialized, deflated and saved to a ".parsed" file.
  
  The converter is designed to be as fast as possible. Most A2L files are processed within 1-2 seconds on reasonable HW.

  Pull requests are welcome
